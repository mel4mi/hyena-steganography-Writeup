  here is our first flag.
  
  Then we need to examine some photos.I prefer the 29a[Forensic-tool](https://29a.ch/photo-forensics/) site for steganography. There are lots of useful effects in it.

  and i found some encrypted message in photo
  
  this encryption looks different from other encryption methods. so I started doing research on the [Dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/chiffres-symboles) site.
